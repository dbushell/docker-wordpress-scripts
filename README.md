# Docker WordPress Scripts

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/docker-wordpress-scripts.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/docker-wordpress-scripts)

DWS is a small set of scripts to manage WordPress containers in Docker. It uses an NGINX proxy for `*.localhost` domains to avoid manual port assignment.

**This is work in progress and unstable!**

Follow [@dbushell](https://twitter.com/dbushell) for updates.

## Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) must be installed and running on your machine.
* Port `80` must be unbound for the proxy server to work.

## Install

Run `npm init` if you don't have a `package.json`.

Install `docker-wordpress-scripts` to the project directory:

```sh
npm install docker-wordpress-scripts --save
```

Or use the `--global` flag to use `dws` commands anywhere without `npx`.

## Usage

```
Usage: dws <command> [options]

Commands:
  dws up [proxy]    spin up a new project
  dws down [proxy]  stop and remove existing containers
  dws stop          stop running containers
  dws start         start existing containers
  dws url           output the *.localhost URL
  dws eject         replace DWS dependency with config files

Options:
  --help, -h     Show help
  --version, -v  Show version number
```

### `up`

```sh
npx dws up
```

DWS will spin up new Docker containers and install WordPress. You'll be asked a few configuration values.

Once successful you'll see:

```
üêπ Success: WordPress is up and running!
‚ûú http://wordpress.localhost
```

### `stop`

```sh
npx dws stop
```

Stop all running containers for the project.

### `start`

```sh
npx dws start
```

Start all existing containers for the project.

### `url`
```sh
npx dws url
```

Output the `*.localhost` URL for the project.

### `down`

```sh
npx dws down
```

Stop and remove all containers for the project leaving no trace in Docker. The database and WordPress content directories will persist in the project repo. Unless they are deleted the `init` command can restore the project.

### `eject`

```sh
npx dws eject
```

Remove the DWS dependency. There is no going back! This adds a copy of `docker-compose.yml` and other config files to the project directory. You can continue by using `docker-compose` in the terminal.

## Portainer

An instance of [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) is also created behind the NGINX proxy. To configure visit:

```
http://portainer.localhost
```
